"""Check one submitted bundle, with no credentials and no course checkout.

    python3 scripts/check_bundle.py submissions/octocat/ch03

This is everything CI can honestly say about a submission without re-running the
notebook, which a fork pull request may never do, because that job holds no
secret and no write token by design.

WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A HEREDOC IN THE WORKFLOW. It was a heredoc for about
an hour, and in that hour the schema moved from v1 to v2 and the copy inside the
YAML did not. Every submission failed on a string nobody could see in a diff. A
file can be read, tested, and grepped.

WHY THE SCHEMA IS DUPLICATED HERE AT ALL. This repository is public and must
never need the private course to check a submission. That duplication is
deliberate, and it is why SCHEMA sits alone at the top with a comment: when the
course bumps it, this is the one line to follow.
